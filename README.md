Hi, I'am Claudio Fabian Stychnicki

Data Scientist and Data Science

Welcome to my git profile

As a manager, commercial throughout my journey, I worked on numerous projects of analysis of adherence, requirements, processes, mapping of gaps/problems for the implementation of ERP solutions. With this information base built, it's time to help companies solve problems. My bias will always have as a premise, a focus and a careful look at the areas that are intrinsically linked to the business areas, for example: supply chain, Intel. Competitive market, looking at the strategic market, flight plan. I became a "Data Scientist-For-Busuness-Problems", to encapsulate all this know-how and analytical skills, to solve business problems, through technology. Having spent the last few years applying Machine Learning, Deep Learning with real business problems in different segments of the Brazilian market. I developed critical thinking and problem solving skills, based on over 35 years of process modeling and business rules improvement for ERP/SAAS and B.I. Consultant for commercial and strategic market planning and process modeling and implementation of high performance sales teams, as well as monitoring and training.

Conceptual pillars and scope People, Processes, Products, Market and Technology Market intelligence Competitive intelligence IBP - Integrated Business Planning S&OP - Sales and Operations Planning My credentials include a Master of Science in data, analysis and statistics, as well as Python programming and its numerous libraries and tools for Data Science. I believe the biggest contribution I can make will be understanding the business issues, with non-obvious delivery solutions, making companies look further and anticipate possible risk factors to predict, prevent and mitigate any non-standard deviations.
